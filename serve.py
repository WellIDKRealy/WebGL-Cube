"""Local dev server that sets the two headers browsers require for
crossOriginIsolated (SharedArrayBuffer / shared WebAssembly.Memory /
Atomics.wait in Workers): Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy and
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy. Plain `python -m http.server` can't set
custom response headers at all, so the real multithreaded build won't
work when served that way - use this instead:

    # socket, not the server's) - surfacing as "Failed to fetch" only for
    # big files, only in Chrome. Firefox doesn't race connections the same
    # way and was unaffected. Binding dual-stack (AF_INET6 on "::" with
    # IPV6_V6ONLY disabled, which is the Linux default anyway - set
